sample:
	TCP
	- tcp/serial:
		- server handles single client at a time


	- tcp/multiplexing_v01
		- server handles single client at a time
		- client uses select() to monitor: socket and stdin


	- tcp/multiplexing_v02:
		- server handle multiple clients at a time
		- server fork new process for each new client
		- client uses select() to monitor: socket and stdin


	- tcp/multiplexing_v03:
		- server handle multiple clients at a time
		- server using select() to:
			- monitor listen socket to check new client connection
			- monitor connect sockets to check data from clients
		- client uses select() to monitor: socket and stdin


	- tcp/multiplexing_v4:
		- reuse sample multiplexing_v03, but migrate client to poll API


	- tcp/multiplexing_v4:
		- reuse sample multiplexing_v04, but migrate server to poll API
	

	ADVANCED IO
	- advio/read_timeout
		- implement read with timeout using select
