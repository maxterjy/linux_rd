	- Edge-triggered monitor: check if there is I/O activity on a file descriptor since it was last monitored


select() and poll() to check if an I/O operation would not block rather than it wourld successfully transfer data

select(nfds, readfds, writefds, exceptfds, timeout):
	- level-triggered monitor
	- sample: select_stdin.c

poll(fds, nfds, timeout)
	- level-trigger & edge-trigger
	- sample: pollin_pipe.c
